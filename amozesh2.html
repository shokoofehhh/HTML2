<h3 id="myheader"><b>What is the difference between a website and a blog?</b></h3>
<p style="background-image:url('aks_gole_narges_zard.jpg');">
Many people confuse the two and use them together, which is not true at all. They have some similarities to each other but by no means should we use them together.
Some of the differences are:
We generally need technical knowledge to create a website, but we do not need technical knowledge to build a blog.
We have to pay to build a complete website but it doesn't cost to build a blog.
Blogs are used for simple tasks, but websites are used for important tasks.
On the blog we can share our personal experiences and memories but on the website we have to post official content.
And…
</p>
<h3 id="myheader"><b>What is the purpose of having a website?</b></h3>
<p>
This is a question that everyone should ask themselves before launching their<span style="color:red"> website</span>. For example, if you are a poet you can publish your own poems on the site and share the basics of poetry or poetry with others, or if you are a seller you can put your stuff on the site and sell it online. 
Give your clients the benefit of a great deal, or if you are a psychiatrist you can post educational content on your site or conduct online counseling sessions to answer your patients' questions.

<h2 id="website1">Website Definition</h2>
<p>
You must have heard of this word: WebSite or have seen it in magazines, newspapers, billboards and so on. In this article, we will explain what your service is.
If we want to have a general definition of the word, we have to say: Websites are a set of pages that are on the Internet and contain various information such as: texts, images, videos, audio files, etc. .
Through websites we can make money or we can share our knowledge with all the people of the world.
And of course, there are numerous applications that we'll talk about later.

<p>Who was the first site designer?
Well the question that has caught many people's minds is who was the first web designer</p>
<h2 id="html1">html Definition</h2>
<p>
<span style="border: 1px solid black">Hypertext Markup Language</span> (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. 
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

<p> HTML History (HTML):
In year 3, physicist Tim Berners Lee, a CERN contractor, proposed the ENQUIRE system. The system was developed for CERN researchers to use and share documents with. In year 2, Burners Lee wrote a note proposing a hypertext internet system. Burners Lee specified HTML and wrote browser and server software late in the day. That year, Berners Lee and CERN Systems Data Engineer jointly applied for funding, but the project was not formally accepted by CERN.
